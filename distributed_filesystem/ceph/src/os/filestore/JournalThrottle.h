/**
 * JournalThrottle
 *
 * Throttle designed to implement dynamic throttling as the journal fills
 * up.  The goal is to not delay ops at all when the journal is relatively
 * empty, delay ops somewhat as the journal begins to fill (with the delay
 * getting linearly longer as the journal fills up to a high water mark),
 * and to delay much more aggressively (though still linearly with usage)
 * until we hit the max value.
 *
 * The implementation simply wraps BackoffThrottle with a queue of
 * journaled but not synced ops.
 *
 * The usage pattern is as follows:
 * 1) Call get(seq, bytes) before taking the op_queue_throttle
 * 2) Once the journal is flushed, flush(max_op_id_flushed)
