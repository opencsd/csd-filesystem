=========================================
 Cloning the Ceph Source Code Repository
=========================================

You may clone a Ceph branch of the Ceph source code by going to `github Ceph
Repository`_,  selecting a branch (``master`` by default), and clicking the
**Download ZIP** button.

.. _github Ceph Repository: https://github.com/ceph/ceph


To clone the entire git repository, install and configure ``git``.


Install Git
===========

To install ``git`` on Debian/Ubuntu, execute::

	sudo apt-get install git


To install ``git`` on CentOS/RHEL, execute::

	sudo yum install git


You must also have a ``github`` account. If you do not have a
``github`` account, go to `github.com`_ and register.
Follow the directions for setting up git at 
`Set Up Git`_.

.. _github.com: https://github.com
.. _Set Up Git: https://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git


Add SSH Keys (Optional)
=======================

If you intend to commit code to Ceph or to clone using SSH
(``git@github.com:ceph/ceph.git``), you must generate SSH keys for github. 

.. tip:: If you only intend to clone the repository, you may 
   use ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/ceph/ceph.git`` 
   without generating SSH keys.

To generate SSH keys for ``github``, execute::

	ssh-keygen

Get the key to add to your ``github`` account (the following example
assumes you used the default file path)::

	cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy the public key.

Go to your ``github`` account, click on "Account Settings" (i.e., the
'tools' icon); then, click "SSH Keys" on the left side navbar.

Click "Add SSH key" in the "SSH Keys" list, enter a name for the key, paste the
key you generated, and press the "Add key" button.


Clone the Source
================

To clone the Ceph source code repository, execute::

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/ceph/ceph.git

Once ``git clone`` executes, you should have a full copy of the Ceph 
repository.

.. tip:: Make sure you maintain the latest copies of the submodules
   included in the repository. Running ``git status`` will tell you if
   the submodules are out of date.

::

	cd ceph
	git status

If your submodules are out of date, run::

	git submodule update --force --init --recursive

Choose a Branch
===============

Once you clone the source code and submodules, your Ceph repository 
will be on the ``master`` branch by default, which is the unstable 
development branch. You may choose other branches too.

- ``master``: The unstable development branch.
- ``stable``: The bugfix branch.
- ``next``: The release candidate branch.

::

	git checkout master
