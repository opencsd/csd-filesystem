Encryption
==========

Logical volumes can be encrypted using ``dmcrypt`` by specifying the
``--dmcrypt`` flag when creating OSDs. Encryption can be done in different ways,
specially with LVM. ``ceph-volume`` is somewhat opinionated with the way it
sets up encryption with logical volumes so that the process is consistent and
robust.

In this case, ``ceph-volume lvm`` follows these constraints:

* only LUKS (version 1) is used
* Logical Volumes are encrypted, while their underlying PVs (physical volumes)
  aren't
* Non-LVM devices like partitions are also encrypted with the same OSD key


LUKS
----
There are currently two versions of LUKS, 1 and 2. Version 2 is a bit easier
to implement but not widely available in all distros Ceph supports. LUKS 1 is
not going to be deprecated in favor of LUKS 2, so in order to have as wide
support as possible, ``ceph-volume`` uses LUKS version 1.

.. note:: Version 1 of LUKS is just referenced as "LUKS" whereas version 2 is
          referred to as LUKS2


LUKS on LVM
-----------
Encryption is done on top of existing logical volumes (unlike encrypting the
physical device). Any single logical volume can be encrypted while other
volumes can remain unencrypted. This method also allows for flexible logical
volume setups, since encryption will happen once the LV is created.


Workflow
--------
When setting up the OSD, a secret key will be created, that will be passed
along to the monitor in JSON format as ``stdin`` to prevent the key from being
captured in the logs.

The JSON payload looks something like::

        {
            "cephx_secret": CEPHX_SECRET,
            "dmcrypt_key": DMCRYPT_KEY,
            "cephx_lockbox_secret": LOCKBOX_SECRET,
        }

The naming convention for the keys is **strict**, and they are named like that
for the hardcoded (legacy) names ceph-disk used.

* ``cephx_secret`` : The cephx key used to authenticate
* ``dmcrypt_key`` : The secret (or private) key to unlock encrypted devices
* ``cephx_lockbox_secret`` : The authentication key used to retrieve the
  ``dmcrypt_key``. It is named *lockbox* because ceph-disk used to have an
  unencrypted partition named after it, used to store public keys and other
  OSD metadata.

The naming convention is strict because Monitors supported the naming
convention by ceph-disk, which used these key names. In order to keep
compatibility and prevent ceph-disk from breaking, ceph-volume will use the same
naming convention *although they don't make sense for the new encryption
workflow*.

After the common steps of setting up the OSD during the prepare stage, either
with :term:`filestore` or :term:`bluestore`, the logical volume is left ready
to be activated, regardless of the state of the device (encrypted or decrypted).

At activation time, the logical volume will get decrypted and the OSD started
once the process completes correctly.

Summary of the encryption workflow for creating a new OSD:

#. OSD is created, both lockbox and dmcrypt keys are created, and sent along
   with JSON to the monitors, indicating an encrypted OSD.

#. All complementary devices (like journal, db, or wal) get created and
   encrypted with the same OSD key. Key is stored in the LVM metadata of the
   OSD

#. Activation continues by ensuring devices are mounted, retrieving the dmcrypt
   secret key from the monitors and decrypting before the OSD gets started.
