## Checking out the source

You can clone from github with

	git clone git@github.com:ceph/ceph

or, if you are not a github user,

	git clone git://github.com/ceph/ceph

Ceph contains many git submodules that need to be checked out with

	git submodule update --init --recursive


## Build Prerequisites

The list of Debian or RPM packages dependencies can be installed with:

	./install-deps.sh


## Building Ceph

Note that these instructions are meant for developers who are
compiling the code for development and testing.  To build binaries
suitable for installation we recommend you build deb or rpm packages
or refer to the `ceph.spec.in` or `debian/rules` to see which
configuration options are specified for production builds.

Build instructions:

	./do_cmake.sh
	cd build
	ninja

(do_cmake.sh now defaults to creating a debug build of ceph that can
be up to 5x slower with some workloads. Please pass 
"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo" to do_cmake.sh to create a non-debug
release.

The number of jobs used by `ninja` is derived from the number of CPU cores of
the building host if unspecified. Use the `-j` option to limit the job number
if the build jobs are running out of memory. On average, each job takes around
2.5GiB memory.)

This assumes you make your build dir a subdirectory of the ceph.git
checkout. If you put it elsewhere, just point `CEPH_GIT_DIR` to the correct
path to the checkout. Any additional CMake args can be specified by setting ARGS
before invoking do_cmake. See [cmake options](#cmake-options)
for more details. Eg.

    ARGS="-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-7" ./do_cmake.sh

To build only certain targets use:

	ninja [target name]

To install:

	ninja install
 
### CMake Options

If you run the `cmake` command by hand, there are many options you can
set with "-D". For example, the option to build the RADOS Gateway is
defaulted to ON. To build without the RADOS Gateway:

	cmake -DWITH_RADOSGW=OFF [path to top-level ceph directory]

Another example below is building with debugging and alternate locations 
for a couple of external dependencies:

	cmake -DLEVELDB_PREFIX="/opt/hyperleveldb" \
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ceph -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-Og -g3 -gdwarf-4" \
	..

To view an exhaustive list of -D options, you can invoke `cmake` with:

	cmake -LH

If you often pipe `ninja` to `less` and would like to maintain the
diagnostic colors for errors and warnings (and if your compiler
supports it), you can invoke `cmake` with:

	cmake -DDIAGNOSTICS_COLOR=always ...

Then you'll get the diagnostic colors when you execute:

	ninja | less -R

Other available values for 'DIAGNOSTICS_COLOR' are 'auto' (default) and
'never'.


## Building a source tarball

To build a complete source tarball with everything needed to build from
source and/or build a (deb or rpm) package, run

	./make-dist

This will create a tarball like ceph-$version.tar.bz2 from git.
(Ensure that any changes you want to include in your working directory
are committed to git.)


## Running a test cluster

To run a functional test cluster,

	cd build
	ninja vstart        # builds just enough to run vstart
	../src/vstart.sh --debug --new -x --localhost --bluestore
	./bin/ceph -s

Almost all of the usual commands are available in the bin/ directory.
For example,

	./bin/rados -p rbd bench 30 write
	./bin/rbd create foo --size 1000

To shut down the test cluster,

	../src/stop.sh

To start or stop individual daemons, the sysvinit script can be used:

	./bin/init-ceph restart osd.0
	./bin/init-ceph stop


## Running unit tests

To build and run all tests (in parallel using all processors), use `ctest`:

	cd build
	ninja
	ctest -j$(nproc)

(Note: Many targets built from src/test are not run using `ctest`.
Targets starting with "unittest" are run in `ninja check` and thus can
be run with `ctest`. Targets starting with "ceph_test" can not, and should
be run by hand.)

When failures occur, look in build/Testing/Temporary for logs.

To build and run all tests and their dependencies without other
unnecessary targets in Ceph:

	cd build
	ninja check -j$(nproc)

To run an individual test manually, run `ctest` with -R (regex matching):

	ctest -R [regex matching test name(s)]

(Note: `ctest` does not build the test it's running or the dependencies needed
to run it)

To run an individual test manually and see all the tests output, run
`ctest` with the -V (verbose) flag:

	ctest -V -R [regex matching test name(s)]

To run tests manually and run the jobs in parallel, run `ctest` with 
the `-j` flag:

	ctest -j [number of jobs]

There are many other flags you can give `ctest` for better control
over manual test execution. To view these options run:

	man ctest


## Building the Documentation

### Prerequisites

The list of package dependencies for building the documentation can be
found in `doc_deps.deb.txt`:

	sudo apt-get install `cat doc_deps.deb.txt`

### Building the Documentation

To build the documentation, ensure that you are in the top-level
`/ceph` directory, and execute the build script. For example:

	admin/build-doc
